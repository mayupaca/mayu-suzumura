        sleeping and eating fishes that my human fished for me we live on a
        luxurious yacht, sailing proudly under the sun, i like to walk on the
        deck, watching the horizon, dreaming of a good bowl of milk, or get
        suspicious of own shadow then go play with toilette paper. Ignore the
        human until she needs to get up, then climb on her lap and sprawl. Have
